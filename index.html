  <p><em>Kung-Fu Teacher</em></p>
  <p>I am a teacher of the traditional chinese martial arts - <strong>Kung-Fu</strong>. I was trained at a Shaolin Temple school in China where I learned various weapons and hand combat forms, as well as acrobatics and fitness workouts.<br> I have showcased
    my skills all around the world in hundreds of performances. My passion for Martial Arts started when I was very young and I have been practicing Kung-Fu since I was 6 years old.</p>
